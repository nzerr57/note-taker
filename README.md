# note-taker

## Description

The objective of this project was to create a program that collects notes from a user and then saves/deletes them at the user's discretion. Once the the user enters a note they are able to save it by clicking the floppy disc icon at the top right corner of the window. Deleting the note is achieved by clicking the red trashcan icon next to the saved note. Adding an additional note is achieved by clicking the "+" icon at the top right corner of the window.

The functionality of this program was created primarily through the Express.js framework and was deployed to the web using Heroku.
